Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit our original research article entitled **"An Integrated Multi-omics and Chemoinformatics Pipeline Identifies IDO1, PDL1, and JAK2 as Host-Directed Therapy Candidates for Leprosy"** for consideration in *Leprosy Review*.

## Summary

Leprosy continues to cause significant morbidity through nerve damage and reactions despite effective multidrug therapy (MDT). This study presents a novel computational approach to systematically identify host-directed therapy (HDT) targets and repurposable drug candidates for leprosy, addressing the critical gap in preventing leprosy reactions and disability.

## Key Findings

1. **IDO1** (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1) was identified as a high-priority target, with strong literature validation for its role in leprosy immunosuppression through tryptophan catabolism.

2. **PD-L1/CD274** emerged as the second-ranked target, consistent with published evidence of PD-1-mediated T-cell exhaustion in lepromatous leprosy.

3. **JAK2** was prioritized, aligning with recent reports of tofacitinib efficacy for chronic ENL treatment.

4. **629 bioactive compounds** were identified, including 45 FDA-approved drugs as potential repurposing candidates.

## Significance and Novelty

This is the first systematic application of an integrated multi-omics and chemoinformatics pipeline to leprosy HDT target discovery. Our findings provide:

- **Translational relevance:** Multiple FDA-approved drugs (JAK inhibitors) identified with published clinical evidence for leprosy reactions
- **Mechanistic insights:** Convergence between leprosy and tuberculosis HDT targets suggests shared mycobacterial immune evasion strategies
- **Clinical applicability:** Prioritized targets (IDO1, PDL1, JAK2) have established roles in leprosy immunopathology with clear therapeutic rationales

The computational approach overcomes limitations of *M. leprae*'s inability to be cultured *in vitro* and provides a rational framework for developing adjunctive immunotherapies to prevent leprosy-associated disability.

## Relevance to Leprosy Review

This manuscript aligns perfectly with *Leprosy Review*'s mission to publish innovative research advancing leprosy control and treatment. Our work addresses:

- **Unmet clinical need:** Novel therapies for leprosy reactions beyond corticosteroids and thalidomide
- **Global health priority:** Preventing disability in the post-MDT era
- **Translational potential:** Repurposable FDA-approved drugs for rapid clinical translation
