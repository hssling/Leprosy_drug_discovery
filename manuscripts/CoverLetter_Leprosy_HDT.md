Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our original research article entitled **"An Integrated Multi-omics Pipeline Identifies IDO1 and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors as Host-Directed Therapy Candidates for Leprosy"** for consideration in *Leprosy Review*.

## Summary

Leprosy continues to cause significant morbidity through nerve damage and reactions despite effective multidrug therapy. This study presents a novel computational approach to systematically identify host-directed therapy (HDT) targets and repurposable drug candidates for leprosy.

## Key Findings

1. **IDO1** (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1) was identified as a high-priority target, with strong literature validation for its role in leprosy immunosuppression through tryptophan catabolism.

2. **PD-L1/CD274** emerged as the second-ranked target, consistent with published evidence of PD-1-mediated T-cell exhaustion in lepromatous leprosy.

3. **JAK2** was prioritized, aligning with recent reports of tofacitinib efficacy for chronic ENL treatment.

4. **629 bioactive compounds** were identified, including FDA-approved JAK inhibitors as potential repurposing candidates.

## Significance

This is the first systematic application of an integrated multi-omics and chemoinformatics pipeline to leprosy HDT target discovery. Our findings provide a rational framework for developing adjunctive immunotherapies to prevent leprosy-associated disability.

## Declarations

- This manuscript is original and has not been published elsewhere
- All authors have approved the submission
- No conflicts of interest to declare
- No funding received for this study

We believe this work will be of significant interest to the leprosy research community and look forward to your favorable consideration.
